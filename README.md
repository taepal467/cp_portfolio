## Inspiration
- These are the portfolios I used for inspiration:

- [Dunks1980](https://dunks1980.com/) - I really liked the simplicity and animations of this portfolio.

- [Lauren Waller](https://www.lauren-waller.com/) - I liked simplicity, the color scheme,  and the font. Too bad the Grandslang Roman font is not free ðŸ˜Ÿ. I don't have the exact background color but 'nude pink' is still a nice color.

- [Keita Yamada](https://p5aholic.me/) - I liked the simplicity and color scheme. But mainly the splash screen.
